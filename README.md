# Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter - VS Code Extension (PG)

This repository is (at least for now) heavily inspired by [Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter - VS Code Extension](https://github.com/TaoK/poor-mans-t-sql-formatter-vscode-extension)
authored by [Tao Klerks](https://github.com/TaoK).

Decision to create new VSCode Extension was driven by original extension being not maintained for last 3 years.

## Marketplace

Extension can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piotrgredowski.poor-mans-t-sql-formatter-pg).

## TODO:

- [ ] Clean up code.
- [ ] Add tests.
- [ ] Add support for `Format selection`.
- [ ] Provide `pre-commit` task. Here or in another repository.
