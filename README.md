# Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter - VS Code Extension (PG)

One of not too many, open source T-SQL formatters as an extension for VSCode.

## History

This repository is (at least for now) heavily inspired by [Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter - VS Code Extension](https://github.com/TaoK/poor-mans-t-sql-formatter-vscode-extension)
authored by [Tao Klerks](https://github.com/TaoK). Also some parts of code are exactly the same as ones in mentioned repository.

Decision to create new VSCode Extension was driven by fact that original extension was not maintained for last 3 years.
Also current version of mentioned extension is not working with modern versions of VSCode.
