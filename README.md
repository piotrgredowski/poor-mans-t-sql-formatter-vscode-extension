# Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter - VS Code Extension (PG)

This repository is (at least for now) heavily inspired by [Poor Man's T-SQL Formatter - VS Code Extension](https://github.com/TaoK/poor-mans-t-sql-formatter-vscode-extension)
authored by [Tao Klerks](https://github.com/TaoK). Also some parts of code are exactly the same as ones in mentioned repositoy.

Decision to create new VSCode Extension was driven by fact that original extension was not maintained for last 3 years.
Also current version of mentioned extension is not working with modern versions of VSCode.

## Marketplace

Extension can be found [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piotrgredowski.poor-mans-t-sql-formatter-pg).

## TODO:

- [x] Clean up code.
- [ ] Add tests.
- [ ] Add support for `Format selection`.
- [ ] Add support for taking configuration options from JSON/yaml file.
- [ ] Provide better README.
- [ ] Provide `pre-commit` task. Here or in another repository.
